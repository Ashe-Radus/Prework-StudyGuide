# <Prework Study Guide>

## Description

My motivation was to create a useful tool to look back on when working through the coding bootcamp. I built this project to showcase what I have learned through the prework. I learned how to self teach and self navigate through multiple resources to fix and build codes. This has notes on HTML. CSS, JavaScript, and Git.
